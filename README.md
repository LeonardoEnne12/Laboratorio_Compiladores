# Compiler Laboratory <h1>

Repository created to explore and demonstrate concepts related to compilers, with a focus on implementations in Verilog and CPU operations.

### Content: <h3>

* **Compiler:** This folder contains scripts and files related to compilation, meaning here the generation of a binary from a C-minus code is carried out.
* **Verilog/CPU:** This folder seems to be focused on FPGA operations (DE2-115 Altera), meaning here operations are carried out on the processor through binary
instructions, and preemption present in operating systems is also performed.

### Languages Used: <h3>

* Python (37.5%)
* C (25.5%)
* Verilog (17.3%)
* Yacc (10.9%)
* HTML (4.3%)
* Lex (3.7%)
* Others (0.8%)
